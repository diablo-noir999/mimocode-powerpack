## CRITICAL: The operation field MUST be a JSON object, NOT a string.

The #1 most common error (issues #561, #161, #909, #1248, #1371) is stringifying the operation:
  WRONG: {"operation": "{\\"action\\": \\"run\\", ...}"}
  WRONG: {"operation": "run"}
  RIGHT: {"operation": {"action": "run", "subagent_type": "explore", ...}}

The operation value MUST be a nested JSON object with an "action" discriminator.

## Available subagent types

The subagent_type field accepts ONLY these values:
- **general** — general-purpose multi-step worker
- **explore** — fast, READ-ONLY codebase explorer (grep/glob/read only)
- Plus any custom agents defined in .mimocode/agents/ with mode: "subagent"

WRONG subagent_type values (will fail validation):
- "build" — not a subagent type (it's a primary agent)
- "plan" — not a subagent type (it's a primary agent)
- "compose" — not a subagent type (it's a primary agent)
- "auto-mode" — this IS a valid subagent if configured, but don't guess

---

## run — Spawn and block until done

Use "run" for one-shot tasks where you need the result before continuing.
The call BLOCKS until the subagent finishes — your turn won't return until it completes.

\`\`\`json
{"operation":{"action":"run","subagent_type":"explore","description":"Find error recovery","prompt":"Search src/parser.ts for error-recovery patterns. Return file:line + one-sentence description."}}
\`\`\`

Required: action, subagent_type, description, prompt
Optional: model, actor_id, timeout_ms, command, context, task_id, output_schema

Key behaviors:
- Blocks until subagent completes (or timeout_ms expires)
- Result returned inline as the tool response
- Use for tasks you need results from before proceeding

---

## spawn — Spawn in background, get actor_id immediately

Use "spawn" for long-running work where you don't need to block.
Returns actor_id immediately; result arrives as a notification later.

\`\`\`json
{"operation":{"action":"spawn","subagent_type":"general","description":"Long search task","prompt":"Search the entire codebase for all TODO comments and summarize them."}}
\`\`\`

Required: action, subagent_type, description, prompt
Optional: model, actor_id, command, context, task_id, output_schema

Key behaviors:
- Returns actor_id immediately (non-blocking)
- Result appears as notification in the conversation later
- Your turn does NOT auto-wake — you see the result next time you respond to the user
- Use "wait" to explicitly block on the actor_id if you need the result now

---

## status — Check if an actor is done

\`\`\`json
{"operation":{"action":"status","actor_id":"explore-1"}}
\`\`\`

Required: action, actor_id

Returns: { status: "pending"|"running"|"idle"|"unknown", actor_id, turnCount, ... }

---

## wait — Block until actor completes

\`\`\`json
{"operation":{"action":"wait","actor_id":"explore-1","timeout_ms":600000}}
\`\`\`

Required: action, actor_id
Optional: timeout_ms (default 600000 = 10 min)

Key behaviors:
- Blocks until the actor completes (success/failure/cancelled) or timeout
- Returns: { status, actor_id, result?, error? }
- CAVEAT: "wait" is for ephemeral subagents (run/spawn). Persistent peers idle between turns and never produce a "done" outcome — wait on a peer blocks until it fails or is cancelled.

---

## cancel — Stop a running actor

\`\`\`json
{"operation":{"action":"cancel","actor_id":"explore-1"}}
\`\`\`

Required: action, actor_id

Idempotent — safe to call multiple times.

---

## send — Message another actor

\`\`\`json
{"operation":{"action":"send","to_actor_id":"explore-1","content":"Focus on the parser module first."}}
\`\`\`

Required: action, to_actor_id, content
Optional: to_session_id, type

Key behaviors:
- Fire-and-forget; returns within ~5ms regardless of receiver load
- Receiver picks up message at head of its next runLoop iteration
- On unknown to_actor_id: returns {inboxID: null, error: "receiver not found"} (does not throw)

---

## models — List available models

\`\`\`json
{"operation":{"action":"models"}}
\`\`\`

Optional: vision (boolean), limit (number)

---

## Context Inheritance

The "context" parameter controls what the subagent sees:

- **context="none"** (default): Subagent sees only the prompt. Clean slate.
- **context="state"**: Subagent gets checkpoint summaries injected (background knowledge, no full detail). Good for tasks that need project context.
- **context="full"**: Subagent sees your full conversation history. Use for state writers, evaluators, or when the subagent needs full awareness. NOTE: This feature has known issues in some MiMoCode versions (#1481, #1486) — if the subagent returns empty results, try context="state" instead.

---

## actor_id vs task_id — Don't Confuse Them

- **actor_id**: Identifies a subagent SESSION (resumable across turns). Pass to run/spawn to resume an existing idle actor. Obtained from spawn/wait/status responses.
- **task_id**: A task tracker ID (T1, T2, ...) from the task tool. Pass to run/spawn to bind subagent findings to a task. The system checks for tasks/<task_id>/progress.md after the subagent finishes.

WRONG: Using a task ID (T4) as actor_id
WRONG: Using an actor_id (explore-1) as task_id
RIGHT: actor_id="explore-1" (from a prior spawn)
RIGHT: task_id="T4" (from the task tool)

---

## Writing Effective Prompts

The subagent sees NOTHING from your conversation — the prompt is its only context:
- Explain what you're trying to accomplish and why
- Say what you've already learned or ruled out
- Give enough context for judgment calls, not just narrow steps
- For short output, say so ("report in under 200 words")
- For investigation: hand over the question; prescribed steps become dead weight

---

## Examples

### Basic explore subagent
\`\`\`json
{"operation":{"action":"run","subagent_type":"explore","description":"Find error recovery","prompt":"Search src/parser.ts and adjacent files for error-recovery patterns. Return: each location's file:line + a one-sentence description of how it recovers."}}
\`\`\`

### Review with general subagent
\`\`\`json
{"operation":{"action":"run","subagent_type":"general","description":"Type checker spec review","prompt":"Read docs/spec.md §3 (Type System), then read src/types.ts and tests/types.test.ts. Report: (1) any §3 requirement not implemented; (2) any test that fails to cover a §3 requirement. Don't fix anything — just report findings."}}
\`\`\`

### Bound to a task
\`\`\`json
{"operation":{"action":"run","subagent_type":"explore","description":"Investigate T4 type checker failures","prompt":"Run bun test src/types.test.ts and report each failing case. For each failure: file:line of the assertion, the expected vs actual values, and the most likely root-cause hypothesis.","task_id":"T4"}}
\`\`\`

### Background spawn with wait
\`\`\`json
{"operation":{"action":"spawn","subagent_type":"general","description":"Analyze test coverage","prompt":"Analyze test coverage for src/auth/ and write the report to /tmp/auth-coverage.md. Return a summary and the file path."}}
\`\`\`
Then later:
\`\`\`json
{"operation":{"action":"wait","actor_id":"<actor_id from spawn>"}}
\`\`\`

---

## Delegation Budget

When spawning multiple subagents:
- Cap each subagent's expected output to ~2000 chars to prevent context blowout
- Use the artifact pattern: have subagents write full output to a file, return only the path
- If a subagent's task is complex, use "spawn" + "wait" instead of "run" to avoid blocking
- Monitor with "status" — if a subagent stalls, use "cancel" and retry with a simpler prompt

## Artifact Pattern

For heavy subagent work, instruct the subagent to:
1. Write full results to a file (e.g., /tmp/analysis-output.md)
2. Return only a summary + the file path in its final message
3. The parent reads the file for full details

This prevents LLM summary-collapse where the subagent loses important details when compressing its output.

## Troubleshooting — Common Errors and Fixes

### Error: "Invalid input: expected object, received string" at operation
**Cause**: You passed operation as a string instead of a JSON object.
**Fix**: Ensure the operation value is a nested object, not a stringified version.
  WRONG: {"operation": "{\\"action\\": \\"run\\"}"}
  RIGHT: {"operation": {"action": "run", "subagent_type": "explore", "description": "...", "prompt": "..."}}

### Error: "Invalid option: expected one of explore|general" at subagent_type
**Cause**: You used an invalid subagent_type like "build", "plan", or "compose".
**Fix**: Only "general", "explore", and custom subagent agents are valid. Primary agents (build, plan, compose) are NOT subagent types.
  WRONG: {"operation": {"action": "run", "subagent_type": "build", ...}}
  RIGHT: {"operation": {"action": "run", "subagent_type": "general", ...}}

### Error: "Actor service unavailable"
**Cause**: Actor.defaultLayer must be running. This is an infrastructure issue, not a format issue.
**Fix**: Restart the session. If persistent, check MiMoCode logs.

### Subagent returns empty result with context="full"
**Cause**: Known issue (#1481) with forkContext in some versions.
**Fix**: Use context="state" instead, or upgrade MiMoCode.

### Subagent hangs indefinitely (run blocks forever)
**Cause**: Subagent may be waiting for a permission prompt it can't interact with (subagents are non-interactive, #1608).
**Fix**: Cancel the actor and simplify the prompt to avoid permission-triggering operations.

### TUI freezes after spawning subagent
**Cause**: Known issue (#1707) in some versions.
**Fix**: Click "Main" in the status bar to return to parent session.

### actor_id resume doesn't work
**Cause**: In older versions, actor_id on run/spawn was dead code (#1562).
**Fix**: Upgrade MiMoCode. If you must work around it, use spawn + send instead.

### Wrong subagent_type for /review or compose commands
**Cause**: Commands falling back to current agent type (e.g., "compose") instead of "general" (#1399).
**Fix**: Always use subagent_type="general" for review subtasks.`
