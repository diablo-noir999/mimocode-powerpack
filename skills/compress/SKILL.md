# Compress

Cut the noise. Every word that doesn't carry information wastes tokens and attention.

## Routing

| What the user needs | Mode |
|---|---|
| Terse communication mode for this session | → **Caveman** |
| Compress a markdown/memory file | → **File** |
| Clean up CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md | → **AgentConfig** |
| Generate docs from code or commits | → **Docs** |

---

## Mode: Caveman

Respond terse like smart caveman. All technical substance stays. Only fluff dies.

### Activation
`/compress caveman` → full mode (default)
`/compress caveman lite` → drop filler, keep sentence structure
`/compress caveman ultra` → extreme compression, abbreviations, arrows for causality

### Persistence
ACTIVE EVERY RESPONSE until explicitly stopped. Off only: "stop caveman" / "normal mode".

### Rules
Drop: articles (a/an/the), filler (just/really/basically/actually/simply), pleasantries (sure/certainly/of course/happy to), hedging phrases.

Keep exact: technical terms, code blocks, error messages, file paths, numbers.

Pattern: `[thing] [action] [reason]. [next step].`

| Level | What changes |
|---|---|
| **lite** | No filler/hedging. Keep articles + full sentences |
| **full** | Drop articles, fragments OK, short synonyms |
| **ultra** | Abbreviate (DB/auth/req/res/fn/impl), arrows (X → Y) |

### Auto-clarity exceptions
Drop caveman for: security warnings, irreversible actions, multi-step sequences where order matters and fragments risk misread. Resume caveman after.

### Examples
❌ "Sure! I'd be happy to help you with that. I noticed that on line 42..."
✅ "L42: null check missing. Add guard before `.email`."

❌ "You might want to consider using async/await here for better readability"
✅ "Use async/await. Cleaner, same perf."

## Mode: File

Compress a natural language file (.md, .txt) to save input tokens. Overwrites original. Backs up as `<filename>.original.md`.

### Process
1. Read the file
2. Apply compression rules below
3. Validate: all technical content preserved, no code modified
4. If validation fails: report error, leave original untouched

### Compression rules

**Remove:**
- Articles: a, an, the
- Filler: just, really, basically, actually, simply, essentially
- Pleasantries: "sure", "certainly", "happy to", "I'd recommend"
- Hedging: "it might be worth", "you could consider", "generally speaking"
- Redundant phrasing: "in order to" → "to", "make sure to" → "ensure"
- Connective fluff: "however", "furthermore", "additionally", "that being said"

**Preserve EXACTLY (never modify):**
- Code blocks (fenced ``` and indented)
- Inline code (`backtick content`)
- URLs, file paths, commands, version numbers
- Technical terms, proper nouns

**Compress:**
- Short synonyms: "big" not "extensive", "fix" not "implement a solution for"
- Fragments OK: "Run tests before commit" not "You should always run tests before committing"
- Merge redundant bullets that say the same thing differently

**CRITICAL:** Anything inside ``` ... ``` copied EXACTLY. Never reorder lines, shorten commands, or simplify code.

### Boundaries
- ONLY compress: .md, .txt, extensionless files
- NEVER modify: .py, .js, .ts, .json, .yaml, .toml, .env, .lock

---

## Mode: AgentConfig

Refactor bloated CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or similar agent instruction files. Apply progressive disclosure: essentials at root, everything else in linked files.

### 5-phase process

**Phase 1: Find contradictions**
Identify conflicting instructions. For each: quote both sides, ask user to resolve before proceeding.

**Phase 2: Extract essentials**
Root file gets ONLY what applies to 100% of tasks:

| Keep in root | Move out |
|---|---|
| One-sentence project description | Language conventions |
| Non-standard package manager | Testing guidelines |
| Custom build/test commands | Code style details |
| Critical overrides | Architecture patterns |

**Phase 3: Group the rest**
Common categories: `typescript.md`, `rust.md`, `testing.md`, `code-style.md`, `git-workflow.md`, `architecture.md`

Aim for 3-8 linked files. Not too granular, not too broad.

**Phase 4: Create structure**
```
project-root/
├── CLAUDE.md           # ≤50 lines, links to everything else
└── .claude/
    ├── [topic].md
    └── ...
```

**Phase 5: Flag for deletion**
Delete if: redundant (agent already knows), too vague to be actionable, states defaults, outdated.

### Root file template
```markdown
# [Project Name]

[One-sentence description]

## Quick Reference
- **Package Manager:** [if not npm]
- **Build:** `[command]`
- **Test:** `[command]`

## Guidelines
- [Topic](.claude/topic.md)
- [Topic](.claude/topic.md)
```

### Validation
- [ ] Root file under 50 lines
- [ ] Root contains ONLY universal information
- [ ] All links to sub-files work
- [ ] No contradictions remain
- [ ] Every instruction specific and actionable
- [ ] Connector paths use relative skill names, not absolute paths

---

## Mode: Docs

Generate documentation from code or git history.

### From code → README
Structure:
```markdown
# [Project Name]

[One-sentence description]

## What it does
[Problem + solution, 2-3 sentences]

## Quick start
[Minimal working example — the fastest path to value]

## Installation
[Commands only, no prose]

## Usage
[Key commands/API with examples]

## Architecture (if non-obvious)
[One diagram or bullet list of components]

## Contributing
[Only if open source]
```

Rules: lead with value, not with how it was built. Examples before explanation. No "this project aims to".

### From git → Changelog
```bash
git log --oneline <from>..<to>
```
Filter: keep `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `security`. Drop `chore`, `ci`, `style`, `test`, `docs`.
Translate: technical commit → user-facing language.
Group: New Features / Improvements / Bug Fixes / Breaking Changes.

### From code → Inline comments
Only comment the *why*, not the *what*. If code needs a comment to explain what it does, the code should be clearer.

Good: `// ML-DSA sigs are 3309 bytes — batch here to amortize STARK proving cost`
Bad: `// Loop through transactions`

## Connector Workflows

- After compressing agent config → run `recon` (Codebase mode) to verify the refactored config doesn't lose critical context
- Caveman mode applies across all other skills when active — `build`, `verify`, `plan`, `recon` all respond in caveman style
- File compression useful before long `recon` or `plan` sessions to reduce memory file token cost
